            Ila Sachani was born in the small village of Moti Vavdi in
            Bhavnagar, Gujarat.
            She was born with a condition that left her hands unable to function
            normally.
            Despite this, her mother and grandmother, who were skilled in
            Kathiawar embroidery,
            encouraged her to learn the craft.

            She not only learned Kathiawar embroidery but also explored other
            styles like Kachhi,
            Kashmiri, and Lucknawi embroidery.
