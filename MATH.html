        <br>
        <br>
        *Aryabhata was one of the earliest Indian mathematicians and
        astronomers. His major contributions include:
        <br><br>
        • <u>Aryabhata</u>: Aryabhata's most famous work, which covers a
        wide range of topics in mathematics and astronomy.
        It includes methods for calculating the areas of triangles and
        circles, and approximations for the value of pi2.
        <br><br>
        • <u>Place Value System</u>: Aryabhata is credited with the
        development of the place value
        system and the use of zero as a placeholder.
        <br><br>
        • <u>Trigonometry</u>: He made significant contributions to
        trigonometry,
        including the introduction of sine and cosine functions.
        <br><br>
        • <u>Diophantine Equations</u>: Aryabhata was the first to solve
        Diophantine equations,
        which are equations with integer solutions.

        <br>
        <br>
        *Brahmagupta was another prominent Indian mathematician and
        astronomer. His contributions include:
        <br><br>
        •<u>Quadratic Formula</u>: Brahmagupta provided the first clear
        description of the quadratic formula.
        <br><br>
        <u>•Brahmagupta's Formula</u>: He developed a formula for
        calculating the area of a cyclic quadrilateral.
        <br><br>
        <u>•Pell's Equation</u>: Brahmagupta made significant progress
        in
        solving Pell's equation,
        which is a type of Diophantine equation.

        <mark>Srinivasa Ramanujan:-</mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        *Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician whose work has had a
        lasting
        impact on various fields of mathematics. CONTRIBUTIONS:
        <br><br>
        •<u>Infinite Series</u>: Ramanujan discovered many new infinite
        series for mathematical constants such as pi.
        <br><br>
        •<u>Partition Function</u>: He developed the partition function,
        which counts the number of ways a given positive
        integer can be expressed as a sum of positive integers.
        <br><br>
        •<u>Mock Theta Functions</u>: Ramanujan introduced mock theta
        functions, which have applications in number
        theory and mathematical physics.
        <br><br>
        •<u>Ramanujan's Summation</u>: He proposed a method for summing
        divergent series, which has been influential in
        the field of analytic number theory.
